Matlab functions to compute network centrality:

Nobelity computes the standard Matlab centrality measure, based on the arithmetic mean distance, but to selected nodes only.

HarmonicCentrality computes an alternative centraliy measure, based on the harmonic mean distance.

HarmonicNobelity computes the harmonic mean distance to selected nodes.
